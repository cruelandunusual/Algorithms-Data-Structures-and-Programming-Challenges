## Description

A repository of my solutions to various programming problems, exercises and challenges from various sources, including:  

* [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
* [The C Programming Language (aka K&R)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language)  
* [Think Like a Programmer](https://nostarch.com/thinklikeaprogrammer)  
* [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)

Some of the code is self-assigned personal challenges (i.e. the idea is my own, although it may have been inspired by an exercise from another source).  

The [wiki][notes] page gives more information on the code, the source of the problem and my approach to solving it.  

The [contents](DIRECTORY.md) page lists the files and folders with a brief description of each category and which language I used to solve a particular problem; the category names are fairly self-explanatory anyway.  

Although I have only relatively recently migrated it to GitHub, some of this code dates from as far back as 2014 -- specifically the C and C++ code, which reflects my interest in those languages at that time, and a particular interest in low-level programming.  

While I'm still fascinated by low-level code and bit-manipulation challenges, my interest in programming has expanded to include different languages and different approaches to problem solving.  

## Running the code

* For **C/C++** files simply compile with `gcc` and execute the resulting `a.out` or `a.exe` file.  
(You may need to enable execution permission of the compiled file on your platform.)  
* For **C#** files, use `dotnet script <file.cs>`.  
* For **JavaScript** files, you'll need Node.js; invoke a script with `node <file.js>`
